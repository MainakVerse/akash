    <td>Space Tourism has always been a fascination for the kids and the olds. What if it becomes a reality after ages of Scientific dedications? Yes, then we all might probably viist those areas in space which we had never dreamt of! Akash is a developer's impression of a sci-fi futuristic space travel with some touch of legacy web designs. This is an imaginative approach to visualize the myths of space travel in space capsules, warp drives and other cosmo-physical theoritical outcomes. We have a dedicated travel page for each of our eight destinations with a never the less, state of the art itinerary for each of them.</td>
